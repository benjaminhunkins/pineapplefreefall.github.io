            <h2>Limited Edition Artist Series Aluminum Bottles</h2>

            <blockquote>
                Back in 2007, Mountain Dew started its Green Label Art program with a series of limited edition designs
                created by graffiti, tattoo, graphic, stencil, and collage artists. The artists were provided with a
                blank aluminum 16-ounce bottle, and were asked to use it as a canvas to create a Dew-inspired design
                with their different mediums and styles.
            </blockquote>

            <p>
                Release parties were held alongside art shows, and the artists incorporated their design into other
                mediums as well (like bicycles or sneakers). Fun fact - this series marks the first time a carbonated
                soft drink was packaged in an aluminum bottle in the US.
                <p>
                Collection time!
                <p>
                It's difficult to find information about these bottles online. I gathered what I could from old press
                releases, eBay listings, photos of event material, and artist pages buried in the archives of the old
                Green Label Art sites. Shout out to the ABC Chapter of the Brewery Collectibles Club of America for
                being a valuable resource here as well.
                <p>
                In all, there appear to be 32 bottles in the Limited Edition Artist Series. I'm fairly confident that
                this list is complete. Note that two are considered “chase” bottles - “The Course Marker”, which was
                used as a promotional bottle to hand out at events and was not available retail, and “Circle of 8” ,
                which was released in low quantities and not advertised. Also, three of the designs from Volume 1 are
                re-issues from 2007.
                <p>
                A handful of promo/test/prototype bottles exist that were not released publicly and are not counted
                here.
                <p>
                A number of similar bottles were released by Mountain Dew around this time; a Halo 3 bottle, 4 part
                NASCAR series and 4 part Stars and Stripes series. For all intents and purposes, these are not part of
                the Green Label Art collection (although they are frequently listed as such).
                <p>
                Volumes I and II (maybe others?) were available in triangular acrylic “VIP” display cases featuring
                inserts with artist and design information. These could be found at events or were sent to certain
                individuals.
