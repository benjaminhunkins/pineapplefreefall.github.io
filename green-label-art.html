                            “Back in 2007, Mountain Dew started its Green Label Art program with a series of limited
                            edition
                            designs created by graffiti, tattoo, graphic, stencil, and collage artists. The artists were
                            provided with a blank aluminum 16-ounce bottle, and were asked to use it as a canvas to
                            create a
                            Dew-inspired design with their different mediums and styles.”
                        </blockquote>

                        <details>
                            <p>
                                Release parties were held alongside art shows, and the artists incorporated their design
                                into
                                other
                                mediums as well (like bicycles or sneakers). Fun fact - this series marks the first time
                                a
                                carbonated

                                It's difficult to find information about these bottles online. I gathered what I could
                                from old
                                press
                                releases, eBay listings, photos of event material, and artist pages buried in the
                                archives of
                                the
                                old
                                Green Label Art sites. Shout out to the ABC Chapter of the Brewery Collectibles Club of
                                America
                                for
                                being a valuable resource here as well.

                                In all, there appear to be 32 bottles in the Limited Edition Artist Series. I'm
                                confident that
                                this list is complete. Note that two are considered “chase” bottles - “The Course
                                Marker”, which
                                was
                                used as a promotional bottle to hand out at events and was not available retail, and
                                “Circle of
                                8”,
                                which was released in low quantities and not advertised.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Three of the designs from Volume
                                1 are re-issues from 2007. The original bottles can be differentiated by the lack of a
                                small
                                white
                                rectangle containing a code next to the UPC.

                                A handful of promo/test/prototype bottles exist that were not released publicly and are
                                not
                                counted
                                here.

                                A number of similar bottles were released by Mountain Dew around this time; a Halo 3
                                bottle, 4
                                part
                                NASCAR series and 4 part Stars and Stripes series. These are not part of
                                the Green Label Art collection (although they are frequently listed as such).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Volumes I and II (maybe others?) were available in triangular acrylic “VIP” display
                                cases
                                featuring inserts with artist and design information. These could be found at events or
                                were
                                sent to certain individuals.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Green Label Art continued involvement in the art scene after 2009, but didn't release
                                much to
                                supermarket consumers. In 2010 there was a “Shop Series” contest, the winner of which
                                had their
                                design
                                featured nationwide on a normal sized can.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In 2013 Green Label Art combined with other Mountain Dew programs to create a digital
                                hub for
                                youth
                                culture called “Green Label” that has since been phased out. It seems unlikely that this
                                promotion will be rebooted, but here's hoping!

                                TWEEQiM is the design studio of husband and wife creative duo miQ willmOtt and THUY3.
                                miQ
                                made an early name for himself creating art for Guns 'N Roses, The Ramones, The Black
                                Crowes
                                and Skinny Puppy. THUY3 got her start working in the entertainment and toy industries,
                                sharpening her skills in painting, digital art and the kustom kulture. THUY3 and miQ
                                came
                                together at their corporate art gigs- miQ as the art director for Hot Wheels and THUY3
                                as
                                graphic designer for Barbie and Matchbox. They soon collaborated on mixed media,

                                Chris Pastras emanates natural creativity. Stemming from his Noside Banks skate roots
                                and
                                extending throughout his dynamic visual art, Chris maintains a unique perception of
                                fluid
                                style and progressive technique. Aware of these qualities, fellow skater and Dew athlete
                                Paul Rodriguez didn't think twice before inviting Chris to participate in a true
                                collaboration of skate and art. During a 72-hour brainstorming session between these two
                                skate icons, various design concepts were thoughtfully sketched. Paul's lifelong
                                aspiration
                                to visit Egypt kept showing up in design ideas, and their creative alliance evoked
                                “Pharaohs
                                of Dew.” The Pastras-Rodriguez partnership is an archetype of cultural object d'art.

                                Troy Denning has 19 solid years of tattooing experience under his belt. Having studied
                                extensively in Europe and Japan, Troy has learned from the best in the industry. With an
                                undeniable passion for his work and the craft of tattooing, it was only a short time
                                before
                                Dew found out about Troy and his Lower East Side fusion studio and gallery, Invisible
                                NYC.
                                With a bivrant and crisp style that pays respect to the Japanese Irezumi, Troy and his
                                studio are big supporters of NYC's tattoo and contemporary art communities.

                                Adam Juresko makes his art almost entirely from cut-n-paste mixed media. It's not a
                                graphics
                                program, but rather a technique that involves literally cutting and pasting with
                                scissors
                                and glue, newsprint type, wallpaper, his own drawings or whatever he can get his hands
                                on.
                                Dew chose Adam to be a part of this project because of his raw, simplistic approach to
                                creativity and design. When Dew ran into trouble downloading his art files for his
                                bottle
                                design, he referred us to a friend who scanned the collage for him. Adam explained:
                                “Sorry,
                                I have no idea how to use a computer.”

                                graffiti crew, The Rolling Thunder Writers (RTW). Dr. Revolt became known for doing both
                                tags and elaborate, colorful murals with psychedelic and comic-art influence on the
                                Broadway
                                No. 1 subway line. His artwork has been featured in classic hip-hop films such as “Wild
                                Style” and “Style Wars”. These days, NYC subways are graf free — but Revolt shows his

                                internationally, in art scenes as diverse as Baltimore and Paris. He was approached to
                                participate in this project as Dew's aluminum bottle provided the perfect canvas for his
                                colorful expressions.

                                posters; he's always had an eye for graphic treatments and color, long before the era of

                                Peat started doing urban-influenced graphics in the early 90's. After seeing the works
                                of
                                guerrilla artist Banksy, he was inspired to try stencils and spray paint to reproduce
                                his
                                illustrations. Now stenciling is his medium of choice because they “look the best on the
                                street.” Dew became interested in Peat after seeing his imaginative viral videos in
                                which he
                                portrays his stencil characters in costume. Check out the video of his rendition of the

                                when they first appeared in the “Dew Circuit Breakout” show on MTV2. Dew was surprised
                                to
                                learn recently that lead singer JT Woodruff is also a conceptual artist, and immediately
                                asked him to be a part of the Green Label Art project. JT likes irregularities in art —
                                “Art

                                started doing urban-influenced designs in the early '90s. Inspired by guerilla artist
                                Banksy, he began using stencils and spray paint to reproduce his graphics. It quickly
                                became
                                his medium of choice. DEW became interested in Peat after seeing his imaginative viral

                                Evan Coburn is a Los Angeles based artist who has studied fine art in both Europe and
                                Southeast Asia. A former chemistry student, Evan strives to express the human element
                                that
                                exists outside of time. He combines a blend of modern day alchemical symbols with a
                                variety
                                of graphic elements to create images that explore the mystery of life. Evan's work asks
                                a
                                simple question. What is it that takes a handful of chemicals and gives it life? With a
                                strong sense of composition and a unique approach to image manipulation, Evan's work
                                explodes with vibrant colors and a dynamic uplifting sense of style.
